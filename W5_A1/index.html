                Seoul was the capital of various Korean states, including Baekje, Joseon, the Korean Empire, Goryeo (as
                a
                secondary capital), and presently South Korea. Strategically located along the Han River, Seoul's
                history
                stretches back over two thousand years, when it was founded in 18 BC by the people of Baekje, one of the
                Three Kingdoms of Korea. The city was later designated the capital of Korea under the Joseon dynasty.
                Seoul
                is surrounded by a mountainous and hilly landscape, with Bukhan Mountain located on the northern edge of
                the
                city. The Seoul Capital Area contains five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong
                Fortress,
                Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty.More recently, Seoul has
                been
                a major site of modern architectural construction - major modern landmarks include the N Seoul Tower,
                the 63
                Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, Trade Tower, COEX, and the
                IFC
                Seoul. Seoul was named the 2010 World Design Capital. It is the birthplace of K-pop and the Korean wave.

                The city has been known in the past by the names Wiryeseong (Korean: 위례성; Hanja: 慰禮城, during the Baekje
                era), Hanyang (한양; 漢陽, during the Goryeo era), Hanseong (한성; 漢城, during the Joseon era), and Keijō (京城)
                or
                Gyeongseong (경성) during the period of annexation to Japan.[18]

                During Japan's annexation of Korea, Hanseong (漢城) was renamed Keijō (京城) by the Imperial authorities to
                prevent confusion with the hanja '漢' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word Han (한) meaning
                "great"),
                which also refers to Han people or the Han dynasty in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for "China".

                After World War II and Korea's liberation, the city took its present name, which originated from the
                Korean
                word meaning "capital city", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, Seorabeol
                (Korean:
                서라벌; Hanja: 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[20] Ancient Gyeongju was
                also
                known in documents by the Chinese-style name Geumseong (金城, literally "Gold Castle or City" or "Metal
                Castle
                or City"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name Seorabeol had the same meaning as
                Geumseong.

                Unlike most place names in Korea, "Seoul" has no corresponding hanja (Chinese characters used in the
                Korean
                language). On January 18, 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters
                from
                the historic Hancheng (simplified Chinese: 汉城; traditional Chinese: 漢城; pinyin: Hànchéng) to Shou'er
                (simplified Chinese: 首尔; traditional Chinese: 首爾; pinyin: Shǒu'ěr).
